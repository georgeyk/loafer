Handlers
--------

Handlers are callables that receives the message.

It could be defined via ``LOAFER_DEFAULT_ROUTE_HANDLER`` setting.

The ``handler`` signature depends on the :doc:`message_translators` implementation.

Usually, it will be similar to this::

    async def my_handler(message):
        ... code ...

Where ``message`` will contain some expected message format.

The ``async def`` is the python coroutine syntax, but regular functions
can also be used, but will run in a thread.

The ``handler`` does not need to return anything, but any unhandled error
will cause the message to be ignored.

You can specify the message to be rejected (and acknowledged) by explicity raising
``RejectMessage``, see :doc:`exceptions` for details.

Successfull executions of ``handler`` will acknowledge (delete) the message.
